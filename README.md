# nas9
This project came about as I built a breadboard computer based on the MC6809
and needed an assembler for it. I had written for my Color Computer 2 using 
EDTASM and very much liked that syntax, and in searching for a similar assembler,
I ended up coming across Albert van der Horst's Linux port of as9. This project 
aims to clean up and improve on that implementation.
